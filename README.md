## 🔊 What is EchoID?
**EchoID** is an audio fingerprinting system inspired by Shazam.  
It can **recognize music from just a few seconds of audio**, even with noise, distortion, or time shifts.  

✨ Key features:  
- 🔎 **Fast recognition** – match a 5–10s clip to your library in seconds  
- 🎼 **Spectrogram peak hashing** – constellation maps + target zone hashing  
- 📂 **Lightweight database** – start with SQLite, scale to Redis/MongoDB  
- 🐍 **Python-first** – hackable, clean, and educational codebase  
- 🛠 **Extendable** – add tempo-robust fingerprints, deep learning embeddings, or a web API

## 📸 How it Works
1. Convert audio → spectrogram (STFT or CQT)  
2. Pick high-energy **spectral peaks** (constellation map)  
3. Create **hashes** from anchor + target peaks  
4. Store hashes in a database with timestamps  
5. Query: compute snippet hashes → look up matches → vote on time offsets → top match wins
